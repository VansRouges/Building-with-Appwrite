# Next.js App Router 14 with Appwrite Integration

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that serves as an introduction to [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/), a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform. The main focus of this project is to demonstrate how to implement client-side authentication, including login, signup, and logout functionalities, using Appwrite.

## Getting Started

To initialize the project, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can also use other package managers if preferred:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install
yarn dev

# pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev

# bun
bun install
bun dev
```

Once the development server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

You can start editing the application by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you make changes, allowing for a seamless development experience.

## Key Features

- **Client-Side Authentication**: Implement login, signup, and logout functionalities on the client side using Appwrite.
- **Next.js App Router 14**: Built using the latest version of Next.js, leveraging the new App Router features.
